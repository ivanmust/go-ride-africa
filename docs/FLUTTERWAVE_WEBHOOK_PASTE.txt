Copy these into Flutterwave Dashboard → Settings → Webhooks
============================================================

1. WEBHOOK URL (paste in "Webhook URL" field):
   http://localhost:3000/api/payments/webhook

   NOTE: Flutterwave cannot reach localhost. For local testing:
   - Run: npx ngrok http 3000
   - Use the https URL it gives, e.g. https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/payments/webhook
   - When you deploy your backend, use: https://YOUR-API-DOMAIN/api/payments/webhook

2. SECRET HASH (paste in "Secret hash" field):
   Copy the value of FLW_WEBHOOK_SECRET from backend/.env and paste it here.
   The same value must be in both the dashboard and backend/.env.

3. Save in the dashboard. Restart your backend if it was already running.
